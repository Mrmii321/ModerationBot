## Setup:
- Create a file in /code called `.env`.
- Add ```BOT_TOKEN=<your discord bot token>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openAI API key>``` to the file.
- Add the logs channel id to the designated part of the code. (will say in `main.py` where this is)
- Run the code.

It is currently known to break when run in some IDEs, so it's best to run the code from cmd prompt or terminal
